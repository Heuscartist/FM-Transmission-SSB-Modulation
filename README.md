# FM-Transmission-SSB-Modulation

This repository is for the university course "Analog and Digital Communication" Complex Engineering Project of created an FM Transmission System using SSB-SC Modulation and an additive guassian noise channel. Following are the requirements of the project
- Perform FM Transmission
- Use SSB-SC modulation
- Add additive gaussian noise to channel
- Record and transmit 2 message signals through the channel simultaneosly
